This fork of ng_mangle exists specifically for lazy PFSense users like 
myself who want the ability to modify TTL and TOS IP headers on specific 
interfaces and don't want to mess with spinning up FreeBSD VMs to compile 
the module. I have simply added a 'compiled' top level folder which contains 
compiled kernel modules for PFSense versions 2.4.3_1 (N-1) and 2.4.4 (N 
release as of this writing).

I have also created a folder called 'pfsense_scripts' which contain ngctl 
shell scripts which other PFSense users may find useful. They can be used 
with something like Shellcmd plugin to load and configure ng_mangle on a 
given interface at startup.

Thanks to Dominik Lupinski for his creation of ng_mangle. If I ever meet you 
in person I owe you a beer!

***NOTE*** If you use the example pfSense script, be sure to set the executable
bit for it (ex. 'chmod +x ng_mangle.sh'). Else it will only be a txt file :)
